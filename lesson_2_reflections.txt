How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is the intermediate of repository and working directory...the staging area allows you to add files to a commit..i.e. it allows you to decide which files to put in a certain commit...we can do this usin git add file_name......bcoz of the staging area all files are not comitted directly unless v want them all to......

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
Using the git add command you can add to the staging area and using the git status command you can find out which changes are to be made i.e the changes which is made but not commited
Using git commit command you can make sure you have one commit per logical change. i.e. changes mentioned in the git status
