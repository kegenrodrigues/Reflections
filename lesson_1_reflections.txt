How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

    by looking at the + and - symbols

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

    1>one can learn from mistakes
    2>reduce lines of codes 
    3>go back to old versions if desired

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

   1>No unnecessary saved versions for minor change
   2>saving versions after crucial changes

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Becoz saving multiple files in one commit is saving a particular state of the system and not only certain files. This is very helpful in case of failure

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    1>git log gives the list of commits
    2>git diff gives the changes made in the commits whose commit id is entered (showing insertions and deletions)

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

    1>Restoring to the previous commit can help a programmer to experiment fearlessly

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Making Projects :)
